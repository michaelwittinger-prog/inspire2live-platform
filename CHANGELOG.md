## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **MVP scope pivot (2026-05-17):** Communications Workspace + World Campus Channel Intake adopted as the new Phase 1 / MVP scope per `docs/PLATFORM_CONCEPT_UPDATE_v1.md` v1.0. Initiative workspace, bureau, congress slice, resource library, and partner portal reclassified as Phase 2 surface area (no code removed).
- Active delivery process changed from Work Packages to **sprints** — see `sprints/`.
- `docs/MVP_SCOPE_AND_ROADMAP.md` rewritten to reflect Comms-first MVP, revised capability layers (L1–L4), revised demo narrative, and revised success metrics.
- `docs/WP_STATUS.md` marked as historical (WP-0 through WP-5); WP-6 deferred into Phase 2.

### Added
- `docs/PLATFORM_CONCEPT_UPDATE_v1.md` — full Concept Update v1.0 specification.
- `sprints/` directory with Sprint 01 through Sprint 04 covering the Communications MVP (Weeks 1–8).
- Invitation system for initiatives and congress (invite by email or platform user)
- Notification system with in-app notification feed
- Password reset flow with dedicated `/reset-password` page
- Auth redirect URL helper with production/localhost detection (`auth-redirect-url.ts`)
- `notifications_type_check` constraint expansion for `initiative_invite` and `congress_invite`
- Unit test suite for auth redirect URL logic
- Documentation overhaul: 8 new docs + 4 populated ADRs + docs index

### Fixed
