# Communications Team Dashboard — Product & UX Spec (Draft for Review)

**Status:** Implemented on branch `team-dashboard` (pending DB migration apply + UX review)
**Author:** Communications workspace working notes
**Date:** 2026-06-07
**Owner space:** Communications Workspace (`/app/comms`)
**Related:** ADR 0006 (Communications Workspace), Sprint 08 (workspace restructure), Sprint 09 (Comms CRM foundation)

---

## 1. Summary

Today the Communications Workspace has a **personal dashboard** — the orange
`CommsDashboardPanel` rendered on `/app/dashboard` for comms users. It answers
*"what needs **my** attention?"* (my tasks, my content, incoming messages,
project summaries, recent decisions).

We want to add a **team dashboard** in the same section: a shared "common
ground" view that answers *"what is the **team** doing, and what needs the team's
attention?"*. Users switch between the two with a single, obvious **toggle**.

The team dashboard's job is to make the whole comms operation legible at a
glance — the two WhatsApp channels (Campus + Communications), all events, and a
single activity/update feed filterable by work status — designed to be **lean,
clean, and usable by people of all ages and comfort levels**. UX is to be
designed and validated *before* implementation.

---

## 2. Goals & non-goals

### Goals
- Add a **Personal ⇄ Team** toggle in the comms dashboard, defaulting to the
  view the user used last.
- Give the comms team one shared screen covering: the two WhatsApp channels,
  all events, and a live update feed.
- Make every item filterable by a **single, normalised work status**:
  *Not started · In progress · Skipped · Completed*.
- Make all events from both stakeholder groups (Campus + Communications)
  intuitively reachable from this one screen.
- Show each team member's **role / user type** (e.g. "Communications") wherever
  people are named on the dashboard, so "who is who" is obvious at a glance.
- Provide a shared **weekly meeting agenda** where team members propose agenda
  items (title + short summary); the proposer is recorded as the **owner**, and
  each agenda item becomes a trackable task on the dashboard.
- Optimise for clarity and low cognitive load across age groups (large targets,
  plain language, no jargon, strong defaults).

### Non-goals (this iteration)
- No new outbound messaging, WhatsApp replies, or sync connectors (consistent
  with Sprint 09 guardrails).
- No new permission model — reuse `canAccessCommsWorkspace`.
- No replacement of the existing planner, events, campus, or CRM tools — the
  team dashboard *links into* them, it does not duplicate them.
- No analytics/reporting charts in v1 (kept for a later iteration).

---

## 3. Where it lives & how the toggle works

- **Route (decided):** add a dedicated **`/app/comms/dashboard`** route that
  hosts both the Personal and Team views behind the toggle, keeping the global
  `/app/dashboard` role-generic. The two views share one URL via a view
  parameter, e.g. `/app/comms/dashboard?view=personal` and `?view=team`. The
  comms "Overview → Dashboard" nav item is repointed to this route.
- **Toggle UI:** a two-segment control at the top of the page —
  `[ My dashboard | Team dashboard ]` — large, high-contrast, with clear active
  state. Persist the last choice (per user) so the toggle "remembers" them.
- **Access:** identical to the rest of the workspace — gated by
  `canAccessCommsWorkspace(role, comms_team, user_type)` in the comms layout.

---

## 4. Team dashboard content

The screen is composed of four stacked content blocks (WhatsApp channels,
events, weekly meeting agenda, update feed), with a filter bar attached to the
feed. Order reflects "shared awareness first, then drill-in." Throughout, every
person named on the dashboard (owners, proposers, senders) carries a small
**role / user-type badge** — see §4.5.

### 4.1 WhatsApp channels (2)
Two side-by-side cards: **Campus** and **Communications**.
- Each card shows: channel name, count of items waiting for review (unreviewed
  intake), the most recent 2–3 incoming signals (sender + one-line summary +
  time), and a "Open channel intake" link.
- Source of truth: `intake_items` already populated by the WhatsApp webhook
  (`/api/comms/whatsapp`). We need a **channel attribute** distinguishing
  *campus* vs *communications* on intake items (see §6 Data).
- Goal: the team instantly sees which channel is "hot" and jumps in.

### 4.2 Events — both groups, intuitively accessible
A compact, scannable list/grid of **all events**, reachable from one place.
- Surfaces upcoming + in-flight events across scopes already modelled in the
  events pipeline (`i2l`, `networking`, plus the Annual Congress and Podcast).
- Each row: event name, date, scope/type badge, current stage, and owner.
- Filter chips: *All · I2L · Networking · Congress · Podcast · Past*. These are
  the events block's **own** scope/type chips and are **independent** of the feed
  status filter (§4.6) — status filtering applies to the update feed only.
- Each row links to the existing event detail (`/app/comms/events/[id]`).
- "Both groups" requirement: events associated with Campus stakeholders and with
  the Communications group should both appear here without the user needing to
  know which underlying list they came from — one merged, filterable view.

### 4.3 Weekly meeting agenda
A shared, recurring agenda that the comms team builds together ahead of its
weekly meeting — the most "common ground" block on the page.
- Any comms-workspace member can **add an agenda item** with a **title** and a
  **short summary** (plain text, a sentence or two — not a full document).
- The person who adds an item is recorded as its **owner**. Ownership is
  automatic and not reassignable from this view (keeps it simple and
  accountable — "you proposed it, you own it").
- Adding an agenda item **also creates a task that appears on the dashboard**
  (in the update feed, §4.4) — owned by the same person, defaulting to **Not
  started**, with the agenda's scheduled date as its deadline. This is what
  "sets the task for the dashboard" means: proposing the topic *is* committing
  to following up on it.
- Items are grouped by the **upcoming weekly meeting** (e.g. "Meeting — Mon 9
  June"); a simple "Add item" affordance sits at the top of that group.
- Each item shows: title, short summary, owner (with role badge, §4.5), and its
  linked task's current status badge — so the agenda doubles as a lightweight
  view of "what we said we'd do."
- Past meetings' agendas remain visible (collapsed by default) as a simple
  running record — no separate "minutes" feature in v1.

### 4.4 Update feed (what's been done / in progress / deadlines)
A reverse-chronological **activity + work feed** — the heart of "common ground."
- Each entry: title, what it is (content card / event task / campus action /
  CRM follow-up / **agenda item**), who owns it (with role badge, §4.5), its
  **work status**, and its **deadline** (if any, with overdue highlighted).
- Aggregates existing work items the team already produces:
  - Content cards (`content_calendar`)
  - Event outputs & tasks (`events`, tasks)
  - Campus actions/decisions (`campus_sessions`)
  - CRM follow-ups (`comms_crm_*`)
  - **Weekly agenda items** (§4.3) — each one surfaces here as a task owned by
    its proposer
- Sort: deadline-aware (overdue → due soon → no date), matching the personal
  panel's existing "Deadlines" logic.

### 4.5 Role / user-type badges
Wherever a person's name appears on the dashboard — channel senders, event
owners, agenda owners, feed item owners, the owner filter — show a small,
consistent **role badge** next to it, e.g. `Communications`, `Board`,
`Platform`. This uses the **existing** `user_type` model
(`src/lib/user-workspace.ts`: `UserType` = `default | comms | board | partner`,
already labelled `Communications` for `comms`) — no new role/type needs to be
invented. The ask is purely to **surface this existing label visually** on the
team dashboard so the team can immediately see who is "Comms," who is "Board,"
etc., without opening a profile.
- Badge style: small pill, neutral colour, e.g. reusing the `*_META` colour
  token conventions already used for statuses/channels (§6 Reuse).
- Source: `getUserWorkspaceLabel(profile)` — already implemented; just needs to
  be rendered in these new contexts.

### 4.6 Feed filters (applies to the update feed only)
A filter bar above the update feed with **three** controls. It does **not**
affect the WhatsApp channel cards or the events block.

1. **Status** — multi-select over the normalised set
   **Not started · In progress · Skipped · Completed** (plus *All*). These are
   normalised statuses mapping the different underlying status vocabularies into
   one simple shared set (see §5).
2. **Owner** — filter to one or more team members (the work item's owner).
3. **Date range** — a *from → to* range over the item's relevant date
   (deadline, falling back to scheduled/created date).

- **Default state (decided):** the feed opens showing **all statuses** — nothing
  is hidden by default. The user narrows down using the status, owner, and date
  filters as needed. Overdue items remain visually flagged regardless of filter.
- Filters compose (AND): e.g. "In progress" + owner "Anna" + "this month".

---

## 5. The unified status model

The platform currently uses several status vocabularies:
- Content calendar: `draft → in_review → scheduled → published → archived`
  (`CalendarStatus`).
- Events: `announced → attending → in_progress → post_event → archived`
  (`EventStage`).
- Tasks: `… → done`.

The team dashboard introduces **one shared status taxonomy** for display and
filtering only — it does **not** change the underlying models. Proposed mapping:

| Unified status | Content calendar | Event stage | Task |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Not started** | `draft` | `announced` | open, not begun |
| **In progress** | `in_review`, `scheduled` | `attending`, `in_progress` | open / in progress |
| **Completed** | `published` | `post_event` | `done` |
| **Skipped** | `archived` | `archived` | cancelled/archived |

**Decision (reviewer, 2026-06-07):** Both *Completed* and *Skipped* map to the
underlying `archived` state — there is no new data state to add. The two are
distinguished **visually only**, in the unified status badge:

| Unified status | Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Completed** | ✅ green tick | the work was finished as planned |
| **Skipped** | 🟧 amber dash | the work was deliberately not done / dropped |

This is purely a presentation-layer distinction inside the status normaliser
(see §6) — e.g. a small piece of metadata or naming convention at archive time
tells the normaliser which badge to render. No schema change is required for
v1; if the team later wants to *report* on "skipped vs completed" separately,
that would justify promoting it to a real field.

---

## 6. Data & implementation notes (high level)

- **WhatsApp channel tagging:** add a `channel` discriminator (`campus` |
  `communications`) to `intake_items`, populated from the webhook payload, so
  the two-channel cards are accurate. Until then we can infer from existing
  routing metadata as a fallback.
- **Status normaliser:** a pure helper (e.g. `comms-status.ts`) mapping each
  source type's status → unified status, fully unit-testable, no DB change.
- **Feed assembly:** reuse the existing server-side fetches already proven in
  `CommsDashboardPanel` (content_calendar, tasks, campus_sessions, events) but
  **team-wide** (not filtered to `author_id = user`).
- **Performance:** team-wide queries are broader; cap each source list and
  paginate the feed. Reuse the `Promise.all` batching pattern already in the
  dashboard page.
- **Reuse:** the `StatCard`, status/stage `*_META` colour tokens, and card
  layouts already exist — the team view should reuse them for visual
  consistency, not invent new components.
- **Role badges (new, lightweight):** no new role/type is introduced. Render the
  existing `getUserWorkspaceLabel` output (`Communications`, `Board`, `Platform`,
  `Partner` — from `UserType` in `src/lib/user-workspace.ts`) as a small pill
  beside any person's name on the team dashboard.
- **Weekly meeting agenda (new data):** needs a small new table, e.g.
  `comms_weekly_agenda_items` — `id, meeting_date, title, summary, owner_id,
  status, created_at`. On insert, a corresponding task entry is created (or the
  agenda item is simply surfaced directly in the feed as its own work-item type
  — implementation detail to settle during build) so it appears in the update
  feed owned by its proposer with status **Not started** and the meeting date as
  its deadline. RLS: any comms-workspace member can read all items and create
  their own; only the owner (or a PlatformAdmin) can edit/withdraw their item.

---

## 7. UX principles (validate before building)

Designed to be usable across age groups and comfort levels:
1. **One decision at a time.** The Personal/Team toggle is the primary control;
   the feed's status/owner/date filters are secondary and collapsible.
2. **Plain language.** "Not started / In progress / Completed / Skipped" — no
   internal jargon (`in_review`, `post_event`) shown to users.
3. **Large, legible targets.** Generous tap/click areas, readable type sizes,
   strong colour contrast (WCAG AA), clear active states.
4. **Strong defaults.** Opens showing all work (no hidden items); remembers the
   last toggle choice. The user narrows down only when they choose to.
5. **Lean over complete.** Each block shows the few most relevant items with a
   "see all" link into the dedicated tool — the dashboard orients, it doesn't
   try to be every tool.
6. **Consistent with the personal view.** Same visual language so switching
   between Personal and Team feels like the same place.

### Recommended pre-build step
Produce a low-fi wireframe / clickable mock of the team view (toggle, two
channel cards, events list, feed + status/owner/date filters) and review it with
2–3 comms users of differing ages before any code is written. UX sign-off is a
gate on implementation.

---

## 8. Acceptance criteria (proposed)

- The team dashboard lives at the dedicated **`/app/comms/dashboard`** route,
  with both views behind the toggle and the global `/app/dashboard` unchanged.
- A **Personal ⇄ Team** toggle is present, persists the last selection, and is
  keyboard- and screen-reader-accessible.
- The team view shows **both WhatsApp channels** (Campus + Communications) with
  live waiting-for-review counts and recent signals.
- **All events** from both groups are reachable from the team view with their own
  scope/type filtering and links to event detail.
- A single **update feed** aggregates content, events, campus, CRM, and
  **weekly agenda** work with owner + deadline, overdue clearly flagged,
  visible to all comms users equally.
- The feed has **status, owner, and date-range** filters; it opens showing all
  statuses, and Completed (✅ green tick) vs Skipped (🟧 amber dash) are visually
  distinct. These filters apply to the feed only, not to events or channels.
- Every person named on the dashboard (channel senders, event/agenda/feed
  owners, owner filter) carries a **role/user-type badge** (e.g.
  `Communications`, `Board`, `Platform`, `Partner`) using the existing
  `getUserWorkspaceLabel` model — no new role is introduced.
- Any comms-workspace member can **add a weekly agenda item** (title + short
  summary); they become its **owner**, and the item automatically appears as a
  task on the dashboard (Not started, deadline = meeting date).
- Access is restricted to comms-workspace users; no new outbound/sync behaviour
  is introduced.
- UX wireframe reviewed and signed off before implementation.

---

## 9. Out of scope / future

- Charts, throughput metrics, and team-performance analytics.
- Two-way WhatsApp interaction or sending from the dashboard.
- Per-user customisable dashboard layouts.
- A distinct underlying "skipped" data state (resolved as visual-only, §5) —
  could be revisited if the team later wants to report on it separately.
- Reassigning agenda-item ownership, threaded discussion on agenda items, or a
  formal "minutes/decisions" capture flow (the agenda stays a lightweight list
  of proposed topics + linked tasks; richer meeting-notes tooling is a
  candidate for a later iteration, possibly folding into the existing
  campus-decisions pattern).
- Introducing any **new** role/user type — "Communications" already exists as
  `user_type = 'comms'`; this work only makes the existing label visible.

---

## 10. Reviewer decisions (resolved 2026-06-07)

All initial open questions are now settled:

1. **Route** — dedicated `/app/comms/dashboard` route hosting both views; global
   `/app/dashboard` stays role-generic. (§3)
2. **Skipped vs Completed** — both map to `archived`; distinguished only by badge
   — ✅ green tick for Completed, 🟧 amber dash for Skipped. (§5)
3. **Filter scope** — status filter applies to the **update feed only**; the
   events block keeps its own independent scope/type chips. (§4.2, §4.6)
4. **Default feed view** — show **all statuses** by default; the feed offers
   **owner**, **date-range (from → to)**, and **status** filters for the user to
   narrow down. (§4.6)
5. **Visibility** — **all blocks shared equally**; every comms-workspace user
   sees the full team view, including all CRM follow-ups. (§2, §8)

### Added in this revision (2026-06-07)
6. **Role / user-type badges** — surface each person's existing `user_type`
   label (e.g. "Communications") next to their name throughout the dashboard.
   No new role is created — `comms` already exists and is already labelled
   "Communications" in `src/lib/user-workspace.ts`. (§2, §4.5)
7. **Weekly meeting agenda** — a shared block where any comms-workspace member
   can add an agenda item (title + short summary); the proposer becomes its
   **owner**, and the item automatically becomes a tracked task on the
   dashboard (appears in the update feed, owned by the proposer, status
   "Not started", deadline = the meeting date). (§2, §4.3, §6)

No open questions remain. Next step is the UX wireframe (§7) for sign-off before
implementation is scheduled into a sprint.
